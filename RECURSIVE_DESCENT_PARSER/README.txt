/* Recursive descent method.
/* 
/* The program receives as input a string containing numeric 
/* expressions (for example, (10 - 5) * 3), and produces 
/* the corresponding result. Numeric expressions can consist of:
/*	numbers;
/*	operators (+, -, /, *, ^,%, =);
/*	brackets;
/*	variables;
/* If the expression contains operators that have the same precedence, 
/* then the evaluation is performed from left to right.
